# getcode

This api is used to retrieve all the code in a page given a url. 

I created this because I used a lot of articles/tutorials to set up things (a digitalocean server for example).

Using this tool will allow me to retrieve the code found in said articles so that I can use the code more easily for things I don't have in my long term memory.
